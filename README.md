# Magpantay_Final_Project_ACP
# I. Brief Project Overview
The Health Bridge - Medical Appointment System is designed to streamline the process of managing patient records, doctor schedules, and appointments within a healthcare setting. By automating the registration of patients, scheduling doctor appointments, and managing medical records, the system enhances efficiency and accessibility for both patients and healthcare providers.

# II. Explanation of How Python Concepts, Libraries, etc. Were Applied
In the development of the Health Bridge system, several Python concepts and libraries were used to make the application functional and efficient:

# Dictionaries: 
Python dictionaries are used to store patient and doctor information, including their IDs, names, schedules, and records. For example, the patients dictionary stores the patient's personal details and medical records, while the doctors dictionary holds doctor information and their available time slots.

# Lists:
Lists are used to track appointments and doctor schedules. The appointments list stores booked appointments, each containing a doctor ID, patient ID, and appointment time.

# User Input and Control Flow: 
The program uses input() to gather information from the user and conditional statements (if, else) to determine actions, such as checking if a patient or doctor is already registered.

# Exception Handling: 
Error handling is used in situations where invalid input could be entered, such as when a user selects an invalid option or enters non-numeric input when choosing an appointment slot.

# Functions: 
The system is structured around functions to organize tasks like registering a patient, adding doctor schedules, booking appointments, and viewing data. Each function helps maintain the flow of the program, ensuring that the code is modular and easy to maintain.

# III. Details of the Chosen SDG and Its Integration into the Project
The Health Bridge - Medical Appointment System aligns with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3: Good Health and Well-being. This SDG focuses on ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being. The system directly contributes to this goal by:
Improving Access to Healthcare: By automating the appointment and scheduling process, patients can more easily connect with healthcare providers, ensuring timely medical attention.
Efficient Healthcare Management: The system reduces administrative delays and errors, making healthcare services more effective and reliable.
Enhancing Patient Records Management: Storing patient records digitally helps in better tracking and management of medical history, leading to improved healthcare outcomes.

# IV. Instructions for Running the Program
To run the Health Bridge - Medical Appointment System, follow these simple steps:

Ensure Python is Installed: Make sure Python is installed on your device.

Prepare the Script: Copy the Python code into a file, for example, health_bridge.py.

Run the Script: Open your command-line interface, navigate to the folder where the file is saved, and run the script by typing:
python health_bridge.py

Interact with the System: Once the program runs, you'll be presented with a menu where you can choose various options (such as registering a patient, adding doctor schedules, etc.). Follow the on-screen instructions and enter the necessary information.

Exit the System: When you're done, you can choose the Exit option from the menu, and the program will close.
